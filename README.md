## Introducing your personal AI Agent

### Current features
- Start / Stop python web server to interact with local model
- Conversational chatbot persisted using local storage

### Future features
- Altering AI agents behavior during conversations
- Embedding vector stores to create longer context
- Use SurrealDB to persist memory
- Replace Python webserver with Rust Llama implementation for more control
- Multiple chats

### Requirements
- create a folder called $HOME/models (I'll update this so the app simply creates the folder if it doesn't exist.)
- Python
- `pip install llama-cpp-python`
- `pip install llama-cpp-python[server]`

### Important Disclaimer**
This is a work in progress and is presented as is with no developer support. PRs and collaborations are greatly welcomed and appreciated.

I'm not a professional developer. I do this as a hobby and simply love sharing / working on projects relating to AI, blockchains, IPFS, and decentralized systems.
